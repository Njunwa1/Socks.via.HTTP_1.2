To do

Next minor release (v1.3)

- Use standard HTTP authentication (with HTTP headers)
- Better encryption method (1 key per user)


Next major release (v2.0)
- Option on the client to use the proxy CONNECT method (faster, because it doesn't use the server part)
- Full socks support (BIND method)
- Configurable bandwidth (total, /user, /connection)
- User ACL : allow or deny user to access sites
- Web Administration console on the Server
- Administration console on the Client


Future
