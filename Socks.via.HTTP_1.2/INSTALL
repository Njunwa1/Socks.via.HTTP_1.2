
This INSTALL file describes the installation procedure for both windows & linux (for unix, please follow the instructions for linux).
You can use:
- The server on linux & the client on windows (my configuration)
- The server on linux & the client on linux
- The server on windows & the client on linux
- The server on windows & the client on windows (most users will certainly do that)

Prerequisites on both server & client
-------------------------------------

You need a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
If you don't have one, install the JDK 1.4 or the JRE 1.4.
You can download it at http://www.java.sun.com
(The JDK 1.2.x & 1.3.x versions are working too. Olders versions not tested)

Installation on Server
----------------------

1- Edit the file classes/socksviahttp/server/initsrv.properties : THIS PART IS VERY IMPORTANT, DON'T SKIP IT OR IT WON'T WORK
2- OPTIONAL : Edit classes/jhttpserver/inithttpsrv.properties to change the HTTP server port (default=80).
              This is not recommended, unless you already have a web server running on port 80.
3- In a console, launch server.bat (for windows) or server.sh (for linux. You may need to do "chmod u+x server.sh" first)
4- Test the HTTP Server : Open a browser, go to the url http://www.yourserver.com/servlet/jhttpserver.ServletTest
5- Test the Socks via HTTP Server part : Open a browser, go to the url http://www.yourserver.com/servlet/socksviahttp.server.admin.ServletAdmin
		and authenticate with the admin login/password you set in initsrv.properties.

PS 1 : If you already have a webserver (as Apache), you may like to install Socks via HTTP
on a real servlet engine like Tomcat. Please refer to the tomcat documentation. Please note
that in this case, the ServletAdmin may not work (problem with the WWW-Authenticate header).

PS 2 : If your server is running on Windows, you can use server-trayicon.bat instead of
server.bat. This allows you to run Socks via HTTP Server as a tray icon (without the annoying DOS
window).

Installation on Client
----------------------

1- Edit the file classes/socksviahttp/client/init.properties : THIS PART IS VERY IMPORTANT, DON'T SKIP IT OR IT WON'T WORK
2- In a console, launch client.bat (for windows) or client.sh (for linux. You may need to do "chmod u+x client.sh" first).

PS 2 : If your client is running on Windows, you can use client-trayicon.bat instead of
client.bat. This allows you to run Socks via HTTP Client as a tray icon (without the annoying DOS
window).
